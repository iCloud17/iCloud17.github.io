                            To the best of my knowledge, there aren't any games online that are similar to this game that I could find. In terms of interaction, the game is similar in terms of user interaction. Here, when the user clicks on a tile, audio feedback is provided. When they click on a wrong tile, the tile also flashes red, something which I plan on doing as well. One of the things that can be improved is the interaction interface, where clicking the keys just changes the color, there isn't really any depth associated with the piano key, which is something I will be working on.

                            In terms of game concept, this game is similar in terms of game flow. Here, the user has to follow the game instructions and push the button depending on the instruction given at the time. It is similar to what I am aiming for, however, this game is old and has a pixelated look. I am aiming for a clean interface. The game's sound effects really add to the experience. The background music adds a sense of urgency to the user. There are also positive or negative audio cues depending on whether the player has successfully followed the instructions. The user has to also be quick to follow the changing instructions, which is similar to what I am trying to do. The game also has a good button click interface, where it is obvious we are clicking the button due to the "pressed" effect.

                        <p>
                            For my final project, I will be creating a new, simple, and fun game! I will not be updating Studio 3, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="../studio3/">Game On!</a>, but creating a new game from scratch. This game is designed to help increase focus, improve reflexes, and help coordinate between your left and right brain!

                        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
                        <p>
                            The goal of this project is to train user reflexes while also having fun! The idea of the game is simple: there will be two boxes that show up on the screen and the text will randomly show up on either side and will randomly be written as '<i>left</i>' or '<i>right</i>'. The challenge is that the user has to click on the box that is <u>written</u>. There will be a total timer countdown, and the user has to get as many correct as possible in the given time! From what I have seen online, most of the time there are just survey-styled 'games', that let the user know if you're more "right" or "left" oriented, but no game to actually help the user get in sync. My game is completely different in terms of concept from the two comparison projects, however, the user interactions will be similar to what we have seen on both these sites. I hope you have fun!

                        <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
                        <p>
                            The entire game site will be designed keeping in mind my overall project theme. Considering this, my color scheme will have a dark background like <span id="bgclr">#242424</span> . The buttons will contrast to the background and be colorful, similar to my game on player 1 and 2 color schemes. The buttons will be symmetrically placed in the middle of the page, taking up a majority section since that is the major element of the game. The text inside the buttons will be centrally placed and of white color to make it easily noticeable to the user. A timer and a score counter will be placed above the buttons. The typography will be simple and common, like Helvetica, since the speed will be key here and the user shouldn't spend time trying to decipher what is written on the screen.

                        <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
                        <p>
                            As explained, the game is pretty simple. The game mostly revolves around clicking two buttons. The buttons on pressing will give a pressed effect along with an audio clip, to add to the user experience. A timer will also be placed in the top right with changing color to indicate the time remaining because the user's focus will mostly be on the buttons. Changing to a red color as time runs short will be easier for the user to tell time is running out without changing focus. Similarly, a score counter will also be on the screen that changes color in the opposite direction, so that the user gets positive feedback. The overall game design is intended to be sleek, something like a mobile game experience found online.

                        <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
                        <p>
                            This game is geared towards getting your left and right brain more in sync, the right will want to click on the pretty colors while the left will try and follow the written text! From scientific analysis, the left brain deals with thinking in words, linear thinking, and factual analysis. The right brain deals with things like visualization, imagination, intuition, and rhythm. This exercise helps the user to coordinate between the two, while also training their reflexes to click on the correct button. I hope that after playing the game a couple of times, their motor control increases over their reflexes, and they have had fun!
