				<h1>Milky Way Galaxy</h1>
				<p>
					This is a beautiful image that I had taken when I went camping with my friends to Jackrabbit Mountains in North Carolina. The photo is taken on a calm night at the shore of Chatuge Lake, where we can clearly see the reflection of the sky and the trees in the background. In this image, we can also see a hint of the Milky Way Galaxy in the middle of the sky. The ambiance of the image evokes a sense of peace and calmness, reflecting the natural state of the photo.

					Join me on our journey through the different constellations, and their mythology!

				<h1>Milky Way Patch</h1>
				<p>
					Long ago, it was possible for everybody in the world to see a dark, star-strewn sky when they looked heavenward at night, rather than the obscuring glow of city lights. In those ancient times, humans looked to the starry sky and saw a ghostly band of light arcing across the heavens, from horizon to horizon. This graceful arc of light moved across the sky with the seasons. The most casual sky-watchers could notice that parts of the band are obscured by darkness, which we now know to be vast clouds of dust.
				</p>
				<p>
					Myths and legends grew up in different cultures around this mysterious apparition in the heavens. Each culture explained this band of light in the sky according to its own beliefs. To the ancient Armenians, it was straw strewn across the sky by the god Vahagn. In eastern Asia, it was the Silvery River of Heaven. The Finns and Estonians saw it as the Pathway of the Birds. Meanwhile, because western culture had become dominated by the legends and myths of first the ancient Greeks and then the Romans, it was their interpretations which were passed down to a majority of languages. Both the Greeks and the Romans saw the starry band as a river of milk. The Greek myth said it was milk from the breast of the goddess Hera, divine wife of Zeus. The Romans saw the river of light as milk from their goddess Ops.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus it was bequeathed the name by which, today, we know that ghostly arc stretching across the sky: the Milky Way - our Galactic Home.

				<h1>Capricornus</h1>
				<p>
					Unfortunately in this photo, we just see a portion of the Capricornus constellation. Capricornus is a faint zodiac constellation located in the southern sky. Its name means “the goat” in Latin. Like other zodiac constellations, Capricornus was first catalogued by the Greek astronomer Claudius Ptolemy in his Almagest in the 2nd century CE. The constellation represents a sea goat, a mythical creature associated with the god Enki in Babylonian mythology and later with the Greek deity Pan, the god of the wild. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In the myth, Pan eluded the monster Typhon (a huge monster in Greek Mythology) himself by jumping into the river Nile and turning the lower part of his body into that of a fish. In reference to the myth, Capricornus is still often depicted as a goat with the tail of a fish.

				<h1>Scutum</h1>
				<p>
					Unfortunately in this photo, we just see a portion of the Scutum constellation.
					Scutum constellation is not associated with any myths. It is the only constellation associated with a non-classical historical figure, the Polish King John III Sobieski. The Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius, who created the constellation in 1684, named it Scutum Sobiescianum, or Shield of Sobieski, to commemorate the king’s victory in the Battle of Vienna in 1683. King John III Sobieski also helped Hevelius rebuild his observatory after a fire in 1679.

				<h1>Serpens and Ophiuchus</h1>
				<p>
					Ophiuchus constellation lies in the southern sky, on the celestial equator. Its name means “the serpent bearer” in Greek. It was one of the constellations first catalogued by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century. Ophiuchus is generally depicted as a man holding a snake, represented by the neighboring constellation Serpens, which is divided into two parts by Ophiuchus: Serpens Caput, the snake’s head, and Serpens Cauda, the snake’s tail. The snake is usually depicted coiled around his waist.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ophiuchus is most frequently associated with the Greek mythical figure of Asclepius, son of the god Apollo, who was said to be able to bring people back to life with his healing powers. Asclepius learned how to do this after seeing one snake bringing healing herbs to another. The healer was struck down by Zeus because the god was worried that the human race would become immortal with Asclepius around to heal them. Zeus’ brother Hades, the god of the Underworld, was concerned that the flow of souls into his domain would dry up as a result of Asclepius’ healing ability. Hades complained about this to Zeus and the thunder god struck the healer down with a bolt of lightning. Zeus later placed Asclepius’ image in the sky to honour his gift and good deeds. The healer became the constellation Ophiuchus, the Serpent Bearer.

				<h1>Saggitarius and Corona Austrina</h1>
				<p>
					Sagittarius constellation lies in the southern sky. It is one of the constellations of the zodiac. It represents the archer. Sagittarius is usually depicted as a centaur holding a bow and arrow. It is also associated with Crotus, the satyr who kept company of the Muses on Mount Helicon. Sagittarius is one of the largest southern constellations. It is easy to find because it lies on the Milky Way and its brightest stars form an asterism known as the Teapot. Like other zodiac constellations, Sagittarius was first catalogued by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century.
				</p>
				<p>
					Corona Australis is a small, faint constellation in the southern sky. Its name means “the southern crown” in Latin. It is located between the constellations Sagittarius and Scorpius.
					
					Corona Australis, the Southern Crown, was known by the Greeks as a wreath, not a crown. Before Ptolemy introduced its stars as a separate constellation, Corona Australis was known as a circlet of stars near the forefeet of the centaur represented by the neighbouring constellation Sagittarius.

				<h1>Scorpius</h1>
				<p>
					Scorpius constellation lies in the southern sky. As we can see here, part of the constellation is under the horizon! It represents the scorpion and is associated with the story of Orion in Greek mythology. Scorpius is one of the zodiac constellations, first catalogued by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century. Scorpius pre-dates the Greeks, and is one of the oldest constellations known. The Sumerians called it GIR-TAB, or “the scorpion,” about 5,000 years ago. The constellation is easy to find in the sky because it is located near the centre of the Milky Way.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Greek mythology, the constellation Scorpius was identified with the scorpion that stung Orion, the mythical hunter. The two constellations lie opposite each other in the sky, and Orion is said to be fleeing from the scorpion as it sets just as Scorpius rises.
					
					In one version of the myth, Orion tried to ravish the goddess Artemis and she sent the scorpion to do away with him. In another version, it was the Earth that sent the scorpion after Orion had boasted that he could defeat any wild beast.
