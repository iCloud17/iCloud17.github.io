                                    overlays in our design. It made sense that back when popups were first introduced, they were extremely useful. Nowadays though, popups are the bane of every user's existence, and the author correctly informs us that
                                    the audience will reflexively try to close the window. The article lets us know how to avoid raising the user's ire, while also making the experience as accessible and better for them as possible.

                                    <br> The article talks about when are the appropriate moments to use modal windows, like when we need to show bigger images or videos. It teaches us about the best practices for implementing a modal page, like giving
                                    the users an easy escape, adding simple buttons, properly sizing the window, and adding focus. The article also includes tips and tricks for implementing mobile overlays, which is a huge help!

                                    <br> Extending on inclusion, the blog post also gives us great ideas to help make the window more accessible for everyone, like making the popup keyboard accessible, using ARIA tags, and keeping low-vision users in
                                    mind as well. This article was super informative and I really look forward to using these tips when I make an overlay!

                                    to design and presentation. While that does present as something to keep in mind, a surprising focus is on human psychology. In hindsight, it does make a lot of sense. A form is more than something that should look
                                    appealing to the user; it is an experience. I can see a lot of these points making form filling an infinitely better experience for the user. I should know since I have been filling out tons of job application forms
                                    online. The next time I have a chance to add suggestions to my experience, I'll take the opportunity to link this article.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> The article teaches us about numerous improvements, which might seem small but elevate the user experience. I especially agree with splitting the form into multiple chunks for it to be more appealing. Adding labels
                                    to each portion and a progress bar was something I wished a lot of my job applications would have. The article also opened my eyes to create a form that was inclusive for everyone, like adding an exclamation sign next
                                    to an alert message to allow color-blind people to understand the context of an alert. The best part of the article is that these changes are simple to implement but infinitely improve the end-user experience while
                                    keeping it inclusive of all people. I'll definitely keep these in mind while designing the mad-libs game next week!
                                    <br>
                                    <br> As for my best form-filling experience in recent memory, it goes to the job application forms from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://jobs.lever.co/atlassian/620921f2-c09c-4d3e-8bd2-f8781fbcc276/apply">jobs.lever.co</a>.
                                    The forms here were simple, clean, and follow many principles that the article proposes. They kept checkboxes instead of dropdown forms whenever there were fewer options, kept the complicated questions for the end,
                                    and were Tab-Ready.
