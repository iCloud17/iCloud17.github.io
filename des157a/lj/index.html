                                    Reading <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099">this article</a> raises conflicting feelings in me. As an avid gamer, many of the pro-tips the author provides regarding advertisements and stores out are things that I hate the most about games. But, as a game developer, I see the logic behind his advice. Most of the article focuses on mobile game development, but there is a wealth of information that can be generalized as well. The author touches on points such as user screen reachability, popups, advertisements, videos, draggable objects, rewarded videos, and more.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Through my experience of this class, I have come to realize that UI/UX enhancements are very subtle, things that normally developers wouldn't think about, but ultimately add up to create an amazing user experience. The tips given in this article aren't any different. One of my most favorite (and hated) subtle tips is regarding the advertisement popups and store open buttons, where the author states that these should be activated on user touch, whereas normally interactive items on a phone screen are activated on user touch-leave. Another interesting tip was to remove the cancel button on popups since users associate that with 'annoying' content, which is counter-intuitive to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">modal overlay article</a> advice which says to always give users an escape hatch. However, the advice does make sense.
                                    <br><br>
                                    These tips really do help increase our critical thinking skills regarding taking into account the little things, and I look forward to implementing them in our game (definitely not the advertisements though)!

                                    For this segment, we had to exchange our image with a group member. Then, we had to do a visual thinking analysis on their image. This is the image that I received from Erika. This image shows the memorial union from UC Davis. The things that immediately stand out to me are the huge signs of the memorial union and the campus store. There also appear to be multiple groups on the left side of the image. Perhaps something is going on on that side? It makes me curious as to what might possibly be going on over there.
                                    <br><br>
                                    One of the things that stand out is the building architecture since it isn't a standard building design. With its brick structure, it gives an older look giving it some character. The lamp style also adds to the entire atmosphere, which is an interesting dichotomy given that they are powered using LEDs. The overall ambiance in the image looks peaceful and amazing, and makes me want to be there when the photo was taken!

                                    This is a beautiful image that I had taken when I went camping with my friends to Jackrabbit Mountains in North Carolina. The figures in the image are standing at the edge of a calm lake since we can clearly see the reflection of the sky and the trees in the background. Given the number of trees in the image, the image does not seem to be located close to any major urban areas. In this image, we can also see a hint of the Milky Way Galaxy on the right side of the sky. This further proves that the image is not near an urban area, because the light pollution tends to obscure this breathtaking sight. It looks like the two people in the image are trying to take a good look at something in the stars, which could possibly be the Milky Way, given its rarity in urban areas. The ambiance of the image evokes a sense of peace and calmness, reflecting the natural state of the photo. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    The overall image setting makes this photograph very interesting, given that a lot is going on in the image. So many stars are rarely seen in urban areas, giving the photo an added interest. The blue streak in the image gives uniqueness and character to the photo, as it helps it stand out from countless other night sky images we have seen. This image deeply relates to me since as a kid I initially wanted to be an astrophysicist. In light of this, I will add information regarding the constellation visible in the image. Something is intriguing about the unexplored vastness of space that is also reassuring in some way. This image also has the added benefit of going with my entire DES 157a project template, especially with the learning journal.

It does deep, gives numerous tips with examples, and is a very self-aware way of thinking- to question regularly, notice details, and build on observations. This will definitely help me when I analyze websites!

                                    This is an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://wanda.net/">amazing website!</a> The website is a portfolio of the Wanda Production company, where we can navigate the website by dragging our mouse around the page, which will scroll it accordingly. It kind of simulates you wandering around in life, stumbling into new experiences! Each picture on the page opens a video. A lot of interpretation and interaction has to be done by the user, and it is fun to guess and attempt to discern the possible meaning behind the images or how to interact with them.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The website really makes you think about what each video may contain, and it becomes a pretty good guessing game. Another bonus is that the videos are dissimilar to each other, which makes every video a new experience. The overall aesthetic of the website is amazing and its color palette is visually pleasing. The website integrates many visual thinking principles, leaving the website as a feast for the eyes and food for thought. I look forward to finding such websites in the future!

                                    overlays in our design. It made sense that back when popups were first introduced, they were extremely useful. Nowadays though, popups are the bane of every user's existence, and the author correctly informs us that
                                    the audience will reflexively try to close the window. The article lets us know how to avoid raising the user's ire, while also making the experience as accessible and better for them as possible.

                                    the users an easy escape, adding simple buttons, properly sizing the window, and adding focus. The article also includes tips and tricks for implementing mobile overlays, which is a huge help!

                                    mind as well. This article was super informative and I really look forward to using these tips when I make an overlay!

                                    to design and presentation. While that does present as something to keep in mind, a surprising focus is on human psychology. In hindsight, it does make a lot of sense. A form is more than something that should look
                                    appealing to the user; it is an experience. I can see a lot of these points making form filling an infinitely better experience for the user. I should know since I have been filling out tons of job application forms
                                    online. The next time I have a chance to add suggestions to my experience, I'll take the opportunity to link this article.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> The article teaches us about numerous improvements, which might seem small but elevate the user experience. I especially agree with splitting the form into multiple chunks for it to be more appealing. Adding labels
                                    to each portion and a progress bar was something I wished a lot of my job applications would have. The article also opened my eyes to create a form that was inclusive for everyone, like adding an exclamation sign next
                                    to an alert message to allow color-blind people to understand the context of an alert. The best part of the article is that these changes are simple to implement but infinitely improve the end-user experience while
                                    keeping it inclusive of all people. I'll definitely keep these in mind while designing the mad-libs game next week!
                                    <br>
                                    <br> As for my best form-filling experience in recent memory, it goes to the job application forms from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://jobs.lever.co/atlassian/620921f2-c09c-4d3e-8bd2-f8781fbcc276/apply">jobs.lever.co</a>.
                                    The forms here were simple, clean, and follow many principles that the article proposes. They kept checkboxes instead of dropdown forms whenever there were fewer options, kept the complicated questions for the end,
                                    and were Tab-Ready.
